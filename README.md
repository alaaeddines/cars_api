# cars_api

The code contains a possible implementation of some endpoints of our API, other endpoints could be implemented like filtering.
There also a Power BI dashboard using the Peugeot dataset of my old scraper that I already did in the past. There are are a lot of limitation in the Data collected as it should be cleaned(For example we have a lot of null values, random values, different ways of writing the same thing : Peugeot/PEUGEOT and it requires more time to do it)
